# 🔗 Project: Smart Irrigation System

## Goal
To develop an intelligent irrigation system that makes real-time decisions on when NOT to water crops by analyzing soil moisture and environmental conditions, ensuring efficient water usage and healthier crop growth

## Problem Statement
Conventional irrigation methods rely on fixed schedules and manual judgment, often ignoring real-time soil and weather conditions. This results in over-irrigation, water wastage, soil degradation, and reduced crop productivity. With increasing water scarcity, there is a critical need for a smart, data-driven irrigation system that can refuse unnecessary watering and provide water only when crops genuinely require it.

## Key Features
• Smart decision logic that automatically refuses irrigation when soil moisture is sufficient
• Continuous real-time monitoring of soil moisture and environmental parameters
• Data-driven optimization of water usage to promote sustainable and efficient farming

## Technical Stack
• Frontend: React, TypeScript
• Backend: Node.js, Express
• Database: PostgreSQL
