# 🔗 Project: Smart Irrigation System

## Goal
To build a smart irrigation system that automatically decides when **not to water crops** by analyzing soil moisture and environmental conditions, helping conserve water and improve crop efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Traditional irrigation systems often water crops at fixed times without considering soil moisture or weather conditions, leading to water wastage and crop damage. There is a need for an intelligent system that can **refuse unnecessary watering** and supply water only when crops actually need it.

## Key Features
- Automatic decision-making to refuse irrigation when soil moisture is sufficient
- Real-time monitoring of soil and environmental conditions
- Water usage optimization to reduce wastage and improve sustainability

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
